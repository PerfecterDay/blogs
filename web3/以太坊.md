# 以太坊

与许多传统货币不同，ETH会随着时间推移变得越来越稀缺。每次有人使用以太坊时，都会销毁一小部分ETH，使其永久退出流通。在交易繁忙的日子里，被销毁的ETH数量会超过新产生的量，这使得ETH具有通缩特性，其价值会随时间推移而增长。以太坊的使用量越大，被销毁的ETH就越多。

When you send $10 in stablecoins to a friend on Ethereum:
1. You open your wallet, add the account address and the amount, then click send.
2. Your wallet signs the payment and broadcasts it to the network.
3. The payment waits in the public queue (mempool) until a block proposer picks it.
4. The block proposer adds it to the next block of transactions, broadcasts it, and earns a fee.
5. The stablecoin contract moves $10 from you to your friend, and both wallets update.
6. A global network of validators double-check and attest to the validity of the changes.

When you mint a $5 collectible on Ethereum:
1. You connect your wallet to the dapp and choose the item to mint.
2. You confirm the purchase; the wallet signs and broadcasts the transaction.
3. The mint request joins the mempool and is added to a block by a validator.
4. The NFT smart contract records your wallet as the new owner.
5. Your new collectible appears in your wallet a few seconds later.
